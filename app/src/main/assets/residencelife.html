<p><b>HAVING ROOMMATE PROBLEMS?</b></p>

<p>1). Fill out your Roommate Agreement Contract at the beginning of the year. Take the contract
    seriously and make sure your concerns are voiced. </p>

<p>2). Talk with your roommate about the concerns you are having. Speaking respectfully and with a
    calm tone can solve many problems.</p>

<p>3). Go to your RA if the issues continue. Every RA has had roommate mediation training to help
    roommates solve problems. </p>

<p>4). If issues continue after mediation is conducted by your RA, you can talk with the Head
    Resident of your area about your concerns.</p>

<p>5). If you continue to have issues after meeting with your Head Resident, you can contact the
    Area Coordinator that oversees your residence hall. They can talk to you about options,
    including options for a room change. </p>
